# PythonEmailSender
My personal project, using sqlite3 and PyQt5.

This is my first complete and public project.

~~ Motivation ~~
      
    Optimizing day-to-day life and solving school problems.
  This progam project was made to solve problems from my school day-to-day life,
  like needing to ask teacher's e-mail always when they ask us to send a homework
  by e-mail and having to send e-mails to multiple students or teachers.
  
~~ What this program do ~~

    Sending e-mails to one or multiple addresseers with one or more attachments.
  It creates a e-mail using a template in html and possibilite you to add several
  attachments to it. You can put every kind of file as a attachment, from everywhere
  in your computer.
    It uses a Database in sqlite3, where you can insert people using it's Module in the
  DataBase directory or openning it with DB Browser.
  
~~ The Modules ~~

  - Data -
    The DataBase module is from where the application connects with the database and brings
  the requested data. It is possible to insert, edit and delete, people data there.
  
  - SendEmails - 
    The SendRoot module is where the Template is set and the selected file is Treated to 
  become a MIME and be attached to the message.
  
  - EmailSenderProgram - 
    The EmailSenderProgram is the Main Module, where the GraphicGui is configured and the
  Program is executed.
  
  ~~ Final considerations ~~
  
  This Project is a whole ideia of mine, it stills have a lot of implementations and functions
  that i'd like to include, but i'm wanting to learn more and soon i'll make other ambitious projects.
  
      Please fell free to make impletmentations and updates into this program, my will is to learn more and more about python and others languages!
